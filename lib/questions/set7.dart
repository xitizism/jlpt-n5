      options: ["true", "false"],
      correctAnswer: "false",
      remark: "The maximum speed of a general motorized bicycle is 30 km/h, so do not drive more than 30 km/h even if a maximum speed of more than 30 km/h is specified."

      options: ["true", "false"],
      correctAnswer: "false",
      remark: "The legal speed limit for motorcycles is 60 km/h."

  QuizQuestion(
      question: "The stopping distance is the sum of the idle running distance and the braking distance.",
      options: ["true", "false"],
      correctAnswer: "true",
      remark: "The stopping distance is the combined distance of the idle distance and the braking distance."
  ),
  QuizQuestion(
      question: "The stopping distance is the distance that a car travels between the time the brakes start to work and the time it stops.",
      options: ["true", "false"],
      correctAnswer: "false",
      remark: "The distance from the time the brakes start to work to the time it stops is the braking distance."
  ),
  QuizQuestion(
      question: "When driving at 60 km/h, the stopping distance is about 20 meters.",
      options: ["true", "false"],
      correctAnswer: "false",
      remark: "At 60 km/h, it takes about 44 meters to stop."
  ),
  QuizQuestion(
      question: "If the speed is twice as high, the idle distance is twice as long.",
      options: ["true", "false"],
      correctAnswer: "true",
      remark: "The idle distance increases in proportion to the speed."
  ),
  QuizQuestion(
      question: "The braking distance quadruples when the speed is doubled.",
      options: ["true", "false"],
      correctAnswer: "true",
      remark: "The braking distance increases in proportion to the square of the speed, so when the speed is doubled, the braking distance is quadrupled."
  ),
  QuizQuestion(
      question: "When the road surface is wet and the tires are worn, the stopping distance can be about twice as long as when the tires are in good condition on a dry surface.",
      options: ["true", "false"],
      correctAnswer: "true",
      remark: "If the road surface is wet or the tires are worn, the stopping distance may be twice as long as usual."
  ),
  QuizQuestion(
      question: "Even if the road surface is wet due to rain, it does not affect the braking distance, so you can run at the same speed as on a sunny day.",
      options: ["true", "false"],
      correctAnswer: "false",
      remark: "If the road surface is wet due to rain, the braking distance will be longer, so it is better to drive at a slower speed than on a sunny day."
  ),
  QuizQuestion(
      question: "When driving at 60 km/h, you can keep a safe distance from the car in front of you if you are driving at a distance of about 30 meters.",
      options: ["true", "false"],
      correctAnswer: "false",
      remark: "The number of speed numbers minus 15 is a guide to the safe following distance, so at 60 km/h, it will be about 45 meters (60-15 = 45)."
  ),
  QuizQuestion(
      question: "When stopping, it is better to stop at a short distance as much as possible, so use the brakes as suddenly as possible to stop.",
      options: ["true", "false"],
      correctAnswer: "false",
      remark: "Sudden braking may cause a rear-end collision and should not be used unless it is unavoidable to avoid danger."

      remark: "When braking on a motorcycle, use the front and rear brakes at the same time to stop in a balanced manner."
  ),
  QuizQuestion(
      question: "Slow travel is the speed at which the car can stop within approximately 10 meters of stepping on the brakes.",
      options: ["true", "false"],
      correctAnswer: "false",
      remark: "The speed at which the car can stop within approximately 1 meter after stepping on the brake is slow."
  ),
  QuizQuestion(

      options: ["true", "false"],
      correctAnswer: "false",

      options: ["true", "false"],
      correctAnswer: "false",
      remark: "Near the top of the uphill slope, the visibility ahead is poor, so be sure to pass slowly."
