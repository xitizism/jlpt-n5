QuizQuestion(
question: "When stopping after the car in front of you on an uphill slope, stop so that you don't get too close, as the car in front of you may be backing up.",
options: ["true", "false"],
correctAnswer: "true",
remark: "When going uphill, the car in front of you may come down, so stop with a distance between vehicles."
),
QuizQuestion(
question: "On steep or long descents, if you use the foot brake too much, you may not be able to brake.",
options: ["true", "false"],
correctAnswer: "true",
remark: "If you use the foot brake too much, it may cause a fade phenomenon or vapor lock phenomenon, which can cause the brake to not work."
),
QuizQuestion(
question: "If the foot brake is used excessively, such as when going downhill, the brake pads and discs may overheat, causing the friction force to decrease rapidly, causing the brakes to become unsqueaky. This is called the vapor lock phenomenon.",
options: ["true", "false"],
correctAnswer: "false",
remark: "This is a fade phenomenon. The vapor lock phenomenon is when heat from brake pads and other objects is transferred to the brake fluid, resulting in air bubbles in the brake fluid."
),
QuizQuestion(
question: "Even if there is a shelter on a narrow road, the downhill car must give way to the uphill car on the slope.",
options: ["true", "false"],
correctAnswer: "false",
remark: "If there is a waiting area, regardless of whether you go up or down, the one closest to the shelter will enter the waiting area and give way."
),
QuizQuestion(
question: "On a narrow road with a cliff on one side where there is a risk of falling, the car on the cliff side stops in a safe place and gives way to the oncoming vehicle, regardless of whether it is going up or down.",
options: ["true", "false"],
correctAnswer: "true",
remark: "It is dangerous for a car on the cliff side to go ahead. First of all, let the oncoming car pass first, and then pass safely."
),
QuizQuestion(
question: "When riding a two-wheeled vehicle, it is better to relax and ride with the right posture.",
options: ["true", "false"],
correctAnswer: "true",
remark: "Relax and drive in the correct riding position that is easy to drive."
),
QuizQuestion(
question: "When riding a two-wheeler, place your heels on the steps so that your toes are pointing outward.",
options: ["true", "false"],
correctAnswer: "false",
remark: "Place the arch on the step and keep your feet pointing straight ahead."
),
QuizQuestion(
question: "When holding the grip of the motorcycle, lower your wrist and hold it lightly, as if pushing the handlebars forward.",
options: ["true", "false"],
correctAnswer: "true",
remark: "Be careful not to hold the grip too deeply. Also, be careful not to put too much pressure on your hand, and hold it lightly, as if you were pushing the handle forward."
),
QuizQuestion(
question: "When riding a motorcycle, relax your arms and shoulders and let your back stretch naturally.",
options: ["true", "false"],
correctAnswer: "true",
remark: "Relax your arms and shoulders."
),
QuizQuestion(
question: "When choosing a two-wheeled vehicle, choose one that can stand on a side stand on level ground.",
options: ["true", "false"],
correctAnswer: "false",
remark: "Choose one that allows you to stand on the center stand, not the side stand."
),
QuizQuestion(
question: "When straddling a motorcycle, if the toe of one foot touches the ground, it can be said that it suits the physique.",
options: ["true", "false"],
correctAnswer: "false",
remark: "It should be something that the toes of both feet can reach, not one."
),
QuizQuestion(
question: "When riding a motorcycle on a curve, disengage the clutch and ride.",
options: ["true", "false"],
correctAnswer: "false",
remark: "If the clutch is disengaged, the power of the engine will not be transmitted to the wheels, and it will become unstable. When driving on curves, do not release the clutch."
),
QuizQuestion(
question: "When turning a curve on a motorcycle, try to keep the body vertical, as it will slip if the body is tilted.",
options: ["true", "false"],
correctAnswer: "false",
remark: "In order to maintain a balance with the centrifugal force, tilt (bank) the car body so that it turns naturally."
),
QuizQuestion(
question: "The brakes of a motorcycle are applied by the brake pedal to the front wheel brake and the brake lever to apply the rear wheel brake.",
options: ["true", "false"],
correctAnswer: "false",
remark: "The brake pedal applies the rear wheel brake, and the brake lever applies the front wheel brake."
),
QuizQuestion(
question: "In automatic motorcycles, the rear wheel brakes are applied with the right hand brake, and the front wheel brake is applied with the left hand brake.",
options: ["true", "false"],
correctAnswer: "false",
remark: "The right-hand brake applies the front wheel brake, and the left-hand brake applies the rear wheel brake."

QuizQuestion(
question: "When braking on a two-wheeled vehicle, it is better not to use the engine brake.",

correctAnswer: "false",
remark: "Apply the front and rear wheel brakes at the same time while applying the engine brakes."
),
QuizQuestion(
question: "On motorcycles, apply the front brakes slightly stronger when braking on dry roads, and slightly harder on the rear wheels when the road surface is slippery.",
options: ["true", "false"],
correctAnswer: "true",
remark: "On dry roads, the front wheel brakes, which have a good braking effect, are operated slightly stronger. Since there is a risk of slipping on slippery roads, use the front wheel brakes, which are more effective, and operate the rear wheel brakes slightly stronger."
),
QuizQuestion(
question: "When braking on a motorcycle, it is better to apply the brakes several times so that the wheels do not lock.",
options: ["true", "false"],
correctAnswer: "true",
remark: "If you brake too hard all at once, the wheels will lock up and there is a risk of falling. Try to brake with plenty of time to spare, dividing the brakes into several times."
),
QuizQuestion(
question: "For engine braking, the braking force increases as the vehicle enters a high-speed gear.",
options: ["true", "false"],
correctAnswer: "false",
remark: "The slower the gear, the greater the braking force."
),
QuizQuestion(
question: "When riding a two-wheeled vehicle, it is better to leave a large distance between you and your passengers than to ride in close contact.",
options: ["true", "false"],
correctAnswer: "false",
remark: "When riding with two passengers, it is dangerous to keep the distance between you and your passengers too close or too wide. Sit at a reasonable distance."
